# Energy Consumption Experiment

This repository contains scripts and data for measuring and comparing energy consumption betwen using and playing Minecraft with a Shader pack vs without . The experiment is conducted using **EnergyBridge** and produces results stored in dedicated output folders.

## **Setup Instructions**
### **1. Ensure the RAPL Service is Running (Only If Not Already Done)**
The **RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) service** is required for EnergyBridge to function properly. If you havenâ€™t set it up yet, follow these steps:

#### **Install and Start the RAPL Service**
```sh
sc create rapl type=kernel binPath="C:\Users\91948\Documents\Q3\Sustainable\Energy_consumption\LibreHardwareMonitor.sys"
sc start rapl
```
*(Replace the path with the correct location of `LibreHardwareMonitor.sys`.)*

## **Running the Experiment**
1. **Set up EnergyBridge**  
2. **Verify EnergyBridge is Working**  
   Test it manually by running:
   ```sh
   energibridge.exe -o results.csv --summary timeout 20
   ```
   If the command runs successfully and generates a `results.csv` file, EnergyBridge is functioning correctly.

3. **Run the Experiment** 
   Execute the `main.py` script with **administrator privileges** to avoid access issues:
   ```sh
   python main.py

## **Notes**
- The experiment is executed **30 times** with and without shaders each to ensure statistically valid comparisons.
- The experiments folder contain other experiments tested out by the team to evaluate significance
